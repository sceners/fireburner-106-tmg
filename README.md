; Fireburner v1.06 Keygen - can be done this way...
; Features: uneccessary floating point operations, linear algo, Byte-Flag-Check.
; Summery: This is what we call a *lame* Protection...boring :-(
; How to find ? -> Procdump 1.6 -> Unpack -> UPX -> fireburner.exe -> W32Dasm -> string search for "(Registered)"
; That's all. Even a blind can see that it's a simple one-byte flag-check which decides if regged or not
; Set some bpm w on the address where the flag appears and restart...
